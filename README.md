### The files

The other files show the prices, ratings, and other info related to wine.

### Perspective

4,653 wine producers in California

1,019 in Washington (State #2 by number of wine producers)

90% of all USA wine is produced in California

Lots of little wineries and a few huge ones

The few huge wineries are in the stores. The many little wineries probably aren't
