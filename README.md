# wine

This repo contains data describing wineries and related info for the livermore, dublin, pleasanton area and beyond

### The files

```vineyards_california.csv``` and ```vineyards_usa.csv``` are somewhat big. They show the name and location of any company that applies to be legally able to produce prodigious quantities of wine. Updated info available via [US Treasury FOIA](https://www.ttb.gov/foia/frl.shtml).

The other files show the prices, ratings, and other info related to a small sample of wineries.

### Perspective

California definitely has the largest number of registered wine producers at 4,653. Washington is at #2 with 1,019. About half of all registered USA wine producers are in California. I read a thing that said about 86% of all USA wine is produced in California, but don't quote me on that.
